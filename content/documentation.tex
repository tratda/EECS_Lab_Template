\section{Documentation - Use bibliography in report per below}
Your report is a graded assignment prepared out of class.  As such, you must document all assistance received.  Seeking assistance is highly encouraged to help you learn and understand the material and concepts.  Your grade will reflect how well you demonstrate an understanding of the material.

The goal is to properly document the work, thoughts, and efforts of others.  Instructors have a professional obligation, both military and engineering, to ensure you have the proper knowledge and understanding of requisite concepts before joining the ranks of either profession.  As such, demonstrate what you know and have learned, instead of what others know.

If a source is used that the instructor doesn't have ready access to, then a copy of that document, (or its pertinent portions), must be included as an appendix.

The standard reference format is ENDNOTES.
