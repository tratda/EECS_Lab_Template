\section{Test Procedure and Equipment}
This section is a detailed record of the procedures used to obtain your data.  In general terms, describe \textbf{WHAT} was measured, \textbf{WHY} it was measured and \textbf{HOW} it was measured.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item This is not a copy of the lab handout!
	\item \underline{Every} prediction in the theory section will have a measurement to validate your theory.
	\item The procedures section should be in adequate detail to re-enact the data acquisition phase of the lab, \textit{i.e.}, the description must provide an adequate record of the measurement methodology.
	\item For each procedure discussed, tell where the raw data and summarized results can be found.
	\item Include diagrams describing what type of equipment is used for the measurement and how the equipment is connected.
\end{enumerate}
