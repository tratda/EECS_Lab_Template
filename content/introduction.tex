	\subsection{Reference}
	Brown, John F.  A Student Guide to Engineering Report Writing.  (Solano Beach, CA: United Western Press, 1985).
	
	\subsection{Audience}
	Good laboratory reports are written at the technical level of the audience.  Assume your audience has some knowledge of photonics, but is unfamiliar with your current topic.

	This is the first section of your written report.  It will describe the specific objectives of the report and the type of circuit being investigated.  For the most part, this is already given to you in the initial handout.  Remember: your report will be written to support this introduction...so, READ IT!
